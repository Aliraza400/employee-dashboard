# Employee Management Dashboard

## Project Overview
Employee Management Dashboard is a React.js based web application that allows users to manage employee records through a clean and user-friendly interface. The application includes mock authentication, a dashboard summary, employee CRUD operations, image upload with preview, search and filter functionality, and printing of employee data.

This project is built as part of a React.js assignment with a strong focus on modern UI/UX, reusable components, and maintainable code structure.

## Assumptions & Design Decisions
- Authentication is implemented using a mock login mechanism with LocalStorage.
- Employee data is stored locally using LocalStorage instead of a backend API.
- A single reusable form is used for both adding and editing employees.
- Profile images are stored as Base64 strings for simplicity.
- Search and filters (Name, Gender, Active/Inactive) work together using combined filtering logic.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive UI.
- The project follows a modular folder structure for better scalability and maintainability.
